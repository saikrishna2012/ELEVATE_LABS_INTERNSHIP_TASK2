# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Titanic Dataset

## Objective
This task focuses on understanding the dataset through visualizations and summary statistics. The aim is to identify trends, relationships, and anomalies in the data before applying machine learning models.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## What Was Done
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset (filled missing values, dropped unused columns)
- Created histograms and boxplots to analyze feature distributions and outliers
- Generated pairplots and a correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between variables
- Noted observations about survival rate trends based on age, fare, and gender

## Key Observations
- Female passengers had higher survival rates
- Higher fares were generally associated with higher survival
- Age and Fare features contain outliers
- Some features show weak to moderate correlations

## Output
- `ELEVATE_LABS_INTERNSHIP_TASK2` – contains all visualizations and code
- Visuals help build a deeper understanding of the dataset structure and behavior
